Hi, Iâ€™m David Wronberg (@wronb-david) a Computer Science student from Dortmund, Germany.

I have been programming - in some form - since highshool. Originally starting out with wrigint desktop applications VB and then looking into webdevelopment ((X)HTML, CSS, SVG, JS, PHP, SQL). When I started my CS degree at TU Dormund I went back to writing desktop applications in Java, since Java was the main language used for the initial courses at university. Whenever a course introduced another language (e.g Haskell for the functional programming course, C for the Operating Systems course) I took a closer look at those. As preparation for the Visual Computing course I started programming in C++. C++ is the primary languague I stuck with since, because it is a multifaceted language, that offers a very interesting mix: multi platform, ISO standard, long history, offering multiple paradigms to choose from, lots of great public resources.

In terms of programming there's merely two fields im not interested in:
* Mobile development - as I'm the opposite of a keen user of mobile devices.
* Game development - as I'd rather play those than work on those - I will write my own mods for those, though.

Besides those two everything else is varying degrees of interesting. From working on small devices like a raspberry pi or even smaller microcontrollers to writing desktop applications, each area has its own appeal.

Outside of programming, like a typical german, I follow my hometown football (soccer) team Borussia Dortmund closely. In terms of sports I prefer going cycling or swimming rather than playing football. When it comes to social activities I perfer a good BBQ or a (board) game / movie night with friends over participating in the usual nightlife.

How to reach me: Since I avoid social media like the plague, a mail at wronb.david@googlemail.com is the easiest way to reach me.
